## Introduction

When talking about increasing trust in data ecosystems there are multiple possible ways to be followed. Contractual and Policy solutions can be taken into consideration to ensure data sovereignty based on analog framework agreement contracts. Blockchain solutions can be implemented to assure that transactions and ownership is mathematically proofed, creating a assertive level of trust in the complete chain. Artificial Intelligence can be used as a neutral party for doing moderation and certification of data of partners and member of the network. However if you want to maintain your data and identify under your control assuring data sovereignty and keeping it decentral the best option to choose are Decentral Identities from the W3C. 

Decentral Identities are already used in the Catena-X Network to digitally identify parties and authorizations across all data exchanges done through an EDC from a peer to peer perspective. This technology is implemented in the current SSI concept used in the network and has been proofed to work and also to be successful when bringing trust to all the data exchanges done which take place in the network.

The data exchanged during the peer to peer connections between EDCs can have different formats, shapes and content. It varies from use case to use case and its up to the owner of the data to choose which data will be provided to who and which one not. However once this data is exchanged there is no assertive way to determine if the data provided is really true or false. Framework agreements cover the legal part of the transaction and participation in the use cases however do not cover the specific product information assertion and confirmation of veracity.

Product Information Certification is the way to go when it comes to creating trust over complete or partial data provided in peer to peer connections between two partners in a network. Once the consumer is allowed to visualize the data he can verify if it was certified by its data issuer or by an external auditor party. This is relevant when we start to talk about bringing the Catena-X Automotive Network to a productive environment, specially where human lives are at stake and mistakes can cause huge monetary and image losses.

This Digital Product Pass Verification and Certification concept aims to create an assertive second layer of trust over the actual peer to peer data exchanges of Product Information. Basing it self in the SSI technology already in place in Catena-X, this concept sets the first steps for data verification statements creation  starting with the CX Generic Digital Product Pass Aspect Model. Giving the data providers the possibility of creating self signed documents confirming the information placed into the aspect models and gives data auditors the possibility to certify one or more specific attributes from Aspect Model documents that are relevant to the data provider business cases. It allows the data consumer to base its processes and decisions based on actual production data which has been assertive verified by external auditors, giving safety that not just the data issuer by also a third party has certified that specific data is true or compliant to standards.

The technology concept consists of creating Signed Documents (Verification Statements) using the Verifiable Credentials 2.0 Technology. Which is in resume a JSON-LD structure standardized by the W3C Consortium for Web 3.0 for data trust and identity assurance. Using JSON Web Signatures (JWS) and a wallet component which is connected to Catena-X and identified by the unique company Business Partner Number (BPN), the data issuer and auditor can sign using their Ed25519 private key and the data consumer can access their public key by resolving the DID contained in the signature proof at the certified document credential. The certified data will be stored in the Data Provider infrastructure sub-model server, in order to assure the data sovereignty. Data consumer can access this data if they are allowed by the data provider simply by looking for the Digital Twin from the specific asset type or instance depending in the specific use case. This data will be retrieved using the EDC connector proxy which is protected by Policies and require data consumers to sign "odrl" contracts to maintain data sovereignty. 

In this way decentral data exchange trust is assertive assured. Making possible and easing the transition from the Catena-X network product data exchange from Pre-Production to Production environments. Enabling better decision taking, saving possible human lives, boosting the circular economy use case, creating testification as form of digital proof for possible framework contracts trust breaks or frauds, assuring product quality and increasing employee safety when hazard materials/products are handled.

This concept has been proofed to be of high interest from the Certification and Verification roles in the Catena-X Community, generating value for multiple use cases and bringing the Catena-X Network Data Exchange Trust Level to a totally new level. Enabling the different network parties to exchange data with electronical proof of an external party certification revision, reducing the risk of failure and error. Allowing data consumers to comfortably invest and deposit their trust in bring their data into a Catena-X Network Production Data Ecosystem Environment.
